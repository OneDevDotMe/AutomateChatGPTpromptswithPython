# ChatGPT Automation Script

This repository contains a Python script for automating prompt generation and interaction with the OpenAI ChatGPT API. With this script, you can simplify the process of sending prompts to the API and receiving generated responses. It's designed to streamline conversational AI experiments, chatbot development, and language generation tasks.

## Features

- Automates prompt generation and interaction with the OpenAI ChatGPT API
- Reads prompts from a file and sends them to the API for response generation
- Saves the generated responses for further analysis or use

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed
- OpenAI API key (sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to obtain an API key)
- Libraries: requests, json (you can install them using pip)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Add your OpenAI API key to the `config.py` file.
4. Prepare your prompt file (e.g., `prompts.txt`) with one prompt per line.
5. Run the script using `python chatgpt_automation.py --prompt-file prompts.txt --output-file responses.txt`.
6. The script will read prompts from the file, send them to the ChatGPT API, and save the generated responses to the output file.

Feel free to modify the script as per your specific requirements or integrate it into your own projects.
